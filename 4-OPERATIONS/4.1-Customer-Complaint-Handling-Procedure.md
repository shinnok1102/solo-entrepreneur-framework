### 4.1. Receipt of Complaint

*   **Channels:** Complaints can be received via email, phone, in-app support, website forms, or social media.

*   **Acknowledgement:** Send an automated or manual acknowledgment to the complainant within [e.g., 24 business hours], confirming receipt and providing a reference number.

### 4.2. Initial Assessment and Categorization

*   **Review:** A designated complaint handler (e.g., Customer Support Lead) reviews the complaint to understand its nature and severity.
*   **Categorization:** Categorize the complaint (e.g., technical issue, billing dispute, service quality, privacy concern, feature request) to facilitate routing and analysis.
*   **Prioritization:** Assign a priority level (e.g., critical, high, medium, low) based on impact to customer, business, and urgency.

### 4.3. Investigation

*   **Assignment:** Assign the complaint to the appropriate department or individual for investigation (e.g., Engineering for technical issues, Finance for billing, Legal for privacy).
*   **Information Gathering:** Gather all relevant information, including customer communication, system logs, transaction records, and internal notes.
*   **Analysis:** Conduct a thorough analysis to determine the root cause of the complaint.

### 4.4. Resolution and Communication

*   **Solution Development:** Develop a proposed solution or course of action based on the investigation findings.

## 5. Escalation Process

*   **Tiered Support:** Establish clear escalation paths for complaints that cannot be resolved at the initial level or require specialized expertise.
*   **Management Review:** Critical or unresolved complaints should be escalated to higher management for review and intervention.

*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct periodic root cause analysis of recurring complaints to identify systemic issues.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Customer Support Team:** First point of contact for complaints, responsible for logging, acknowledging, and initial assessment.
