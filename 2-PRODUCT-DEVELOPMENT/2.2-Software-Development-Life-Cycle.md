# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for Solo Entrepreneurs

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines a streamlined and optimized Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) tailored for a solo entrepreneur. The primary goal is to achieve rapid product development and market entry by focusing on efficiency, automation, and continuous iteration, without compromising essential quality.

### 1.2. Scope
This SDLC applies to all software development projects undertaken by the solo entrepreneur, including new product development, feature enhancements, and system integrations.

### 1.3. SDLC Model
This framework adopts a Lean Agile approach, emphasizing iterative development, continuous feedback, and heavy reliance on automation. The phases below provide a flexible guideline, designed to be adapted to specific project needs and to maximize the solo entrepreneur's efficiency.

## 2. SDLC Phases

### 2.1. Phase 1: Requirements Definition and Prioritization

*   **Objective:** To clearly define and prioritize the functional and non-functional requirements of the software product, focusing on delivering maximum value with minimal effort.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Directly capture user needs and business goals (e.g., through personal insights, informal user feedback).
    *   Formulate concise, actionable User Stories.
    *   Analyze and ruthlessly prioritize features for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
    *   Continuously refine the product backlog based on feedback and market needs.
*   **Deliverables:** Prioritized Product Backlog (e.g., in a simple project management tool like Trello/GitHub Issues), concise User Stories, and potentially a lean Product Requirements Document (PRD) as a Markdown file (if needed for clarity or future collaboration).

### 2.2. Phase 2: Lean Design

*   **Objective:** To define the essential architecture and design elements required to meet the prioritized requirements, focusing on clarity and efficiency over extensive documentation.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Develop high-level system architecture concepts.
    *   Design core database schema (often defined directly in code).
    *   Create functional UI/UX prototypes or sketches for rapid iteration.
    *   Document key design decisions concisely, often within code comments or embedded diagrams in Markdown files.
*   **Deliverables:** High-level architectural diagrams (e.g., Mermaid/PlantUML embedded in Markdown), concise design notes, functional UI/UX prototypes, and database schema defined directly in code.

### 2.3. Phase 3: Automated Implementation (Coding)

*   **Objective:** To translate the design into high-quality, executable code, leveraging automation and AI assistance to maintain standards and efficiency.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Write code following established Coding Standards and Best Practices (enforced by linters and AI Agents).
    *   Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for integrated testing.
    *   Utilize IDE AI Agents (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf) for code generation, refactoring, and adherence to guidelines.
    *   Perform continuous integration of code changes.
*   **Deliverables:** Clean, well-tested Source Code, automated Unit Test Reports, and clear Git commit history.

### 2.4. Phase 4: Continuous Testing

*   **Objective:** To continuously verify that the software meets requirements and is free of defects, primarily through automation.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Develop and maintain comprehensive automated test suites (unit, integration, end-to-end tests).
    *   Execute automated tests as part of the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.
    *   Perform focused exploratory testing for critical paths and new features.
    *   Integrate lightweight performance and security checks into the development workflow.
    *   Track and prioritize defects efficiently within the project management tool.
*   **Deliverables:** Automated Test Suites, concise Test Reports (from CI), and a prioritized Bug List.

### 2.5. Phase 5: Automated Deployment

*   **Objective:** To reliably and rapidly release the software product to the production environment through fully automated processes.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Implement a fully automated Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.
    *   Configure production environment for automated deployments.
    *   Define Infrastructure as Code (IaC) where applicable for consistent environments.
    *   Automate post-deployment verification checks.
*   **Deliverables:** Fully Automated Deployment Pipeline, concise Release Notes (potentially auto-generated from commit messages).

### 2.6. Phase 6: Proactive Maintenance and Support

*   **Objective:** To ensure the software continues to function effectively, address issues, and gather feedback for continuous improvement.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Set up proactive monitoring and alerting for system performance and errors.
    *   Establish streamlined support channels (e.g., dedicated email, simple ticketing system).
    *   Implement bug fixes and minor enhancements based on monitoring and user feedback.
    *   Integrate feedback directly into the product backlog for future updates.
    *   Consider leveraging AI for basic support triage.
*   **Deliverables:** Monitoring Dashboards, prioritized Support Queue, updated Product Backlog.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities (Solo Entrepreneur)

As a solo entrepreneur, you embody all roles, acting as:

*   **Product Manager:** Defines vision, prioritizes features, gathers feedback.
*   **Architect/Developer:** Designs, codes, and implements the software.
*   **QA/Tester:** Ensures quality through automated and exploratory testing.
*   **DevOps Engineer:** Manages infrastructure, CI/CD, and deployments.
*   **Support/Operations:** Monitors, maintains, and supports the deployed product.

## 4. Quality Assurance and Continuous Improvement

Quality is integrated throughout the SDLC, primarily through automation and continuous feedback loops. Automated tests, linters, and CI/CD pipelines serve as primary quality gates. Regular self-review and direct user feedback drive continuous improvement.

## 5. Tools and Technologies

*   **IDE with AI Agent:** Cursor, Windsurf (for coding, refactoring, adherence to guidelines).
*   **Project Management:** GitHub Issues, GitHub Projects (for backlog, task tracking, lean defect tracking).
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket (for source code management, collaboration, and CI/CD triggers).
*   **Automated Testing:** Pytest, Jest, Selenium, Playwright (for unit, integration, E2E tests).
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify, Google Cloud Run (for automated builds, tests, and deployments).
*   **Monitoring:** Sentry, Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana (for error tracking, performance monitoring, alerting).
*   **Documentation:** Markdown files, Mermaid/PlantUML (for lean, embedded documentation).

This optimized SDLC emphasizes agility, automation, and direct feedback, enabling a solo entrepreneur to efficiently develop and deliver high-quality software products.
