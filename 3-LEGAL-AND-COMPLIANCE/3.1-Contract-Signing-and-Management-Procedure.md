### 3.1. Contract Request and Initiation

*   **Request:** Any department or individual requiring a contract (e.g., sales, procurement, HR) must submit a formal contract request, outlining the purpose, key terms, and parties involved.
*   **Initial Review:** The requesting party conducts an initial review to ensure the contract aligns with business needs and TDT's policies.

### 3.2. Contract Drafting and Negotiation

*   **Risk Assessment:** A comprehensive risk assessment (legal, financial, operational, reputational) is conducted for all significant contracts during negotiation.

### 3.3. Contract Review and Approval

*   **Legal Review:** All contracts must be reviewed by TDT's legal counsel (or designated legal advisor) to ensure legal compliance, mitigate risks, and protect TDT's interests.
*   **Financial Review:** Contracts with financial implications must be reviewed and approved by the finance department.
*   **Management Approval:** Contracts require approval from the authorized signatory based on TDT's Delegation of Authority Matrix (e.g., Head of Department, CEO, Board of Members).

### 3.4. Contract Signing and Execution

*   **Authorized Signatories:** Only individuals with delegated authority may sign contracts on behalf of TDT.
*   **Execution:** Ensure all parties properly execute the contract (e.g., wet signature, electronic signature).

### 3.5. Contract Storage and Record-Keeping

*   **Centralized Repository:** All executed contracts must be stored in a designated, secure, and centralized contract management system or repository.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure authorized personnel can easily access contract information.
*   **Record Retention:** Retain contracts and related documents for the period required by law and TDT's record retention policy.

### 3.6. Contract Performance and Monitoring

*   **Obligation Tracking:** The responsible department monitors the performance of contractual obligations by both TDT and the counterparty.
*   **Compliance:** Ensure ongoing compliance with all terms and conditions of the contract.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Follow established procedures for resolving any disputes or breaches of contract.

### 3.7. Contract Amendment, Renewal, and Termination

*   **Amendments:** Any changes to an existing contract must follow the same review and approval process as new contracts.
