# Project Documentation Guidelines for AI Agent

As an AI Agent, you are responsible for generating and maintaining project-specific documentation within the `projects/<project-name>/docs/` directory. This guide provides detailed rules and best practices for creating clear, consistent, and comprehensive documentation for each individual software project.

## 1. Purpose of Project Documentation

Project documentation serves several critical purposes:

*   **Knowledge Transfer:** Ensures that all project-specific knowledge (design decisions, technical implementations, usage instructions) is captured and easily accessible.
*   **Onboarding:** Facilitates faster onboarding for new contributors (including future AI Agents or human collaborators).
*   **Maintenance & Support:** Provides essential information for maintaining, debugging, and supporting the application.
*   **Compliance:** Helps ensure that project-specific details align with the overarching company policies defined in the `solo-entrepreneur-framework`.

## 2. General Principles for Project Documentation

Adhere to these principles when creating or updating any project documentation:

*   **Accuracy:** All information must be factually correct and up-to-date.
*   **Clarity & Conciseness:** Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it clearly. Get straight to the point.
*   **Completeness:** Provide all necessary information for the intended audience to understand and use the documented component.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent tone, style, and formatting across all documents within a project and, where applicable, across different projects.
*   **Readability:** Use Markdown effectively with headings, lists, code blocks, and tables to enhance readability.
*   **Version Control:** All documentation must be version-controlled alongside the code in the project repository. Changes should be tracked with meaningful commit messages.
*   **Audience Awareness:** Tailor the content and level of detail to the intended audience (e.g., technical documentation for developers, user manuals for end-users).

## 3. Standard Project Documentation Structure (`projects/<project-name>/docs/`)

Each project's `docs/` directory should follow a consistent internal structure. While not all subdirectories may be necessary for every project, they provide a logical organization.

```
/projects/<project-name>/docs/
├── README.md              # Project-level documentation overview, quick links
├── architecture/          # High-level system architecture, design decisions, diagrams
│   └── README.md
├── api/                   # API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger spec, endpoint details)
│   └── README.md
├── user-manual/           # User guides, how-to articles for end-users
│   └── README.md
├── coding-standards.md    # Project-specific coding conventions (if different from global)
├── testing-guidelines.md  # Project-specific testing strategies/guidelines
├── deployment-procedures.md # Project-specific deployment steps
└── troubleshooting.md     # Common issues and their resolutions
```

### 3.1. `README.md` (Project-level Documentation Overview)

This is the entry point for project-specific documentation. It should provide:

*   A brief overview of the project's documentation.
*   Links to key documents within the `docs/` directory.
*   A quick guide on how to navigate the project's documentation.

### 3.2. `architecture/`

Contains documents detailing the system's architecture. This includes:

*   **High-level diagrams:** Use tools like Mermaid or PlantUML for diagrams that can be rendered directly from Markdown.
*   **Design Decisions:** Explain significant architectural choices and their rationale.
*   **Component Overview:** Describe the main components of the system and their interactions.

### 3.3. `api/`

Dedicated to API documentation. This should include:

*   **OpenAPI/Swagger Specification:** If applicable, the `openapi.yaml` or `swagger.json` file.
*   **Endpoint Details:** For each API endpoint, describe its purpose, HTTP method, URL, request parameters, response format, and error codes.
*   **Authentication:** How to authenticate with the API.

### 3.4. `user-manual/`

Provides guides for end-users. Content should be non-technical and focus on how to use the application's features. Examples:

*   Step-by-step guides for common tasks.
*   Feature explanations.
*   FAQs.

### 3.5. Project-Specific Guidelines (`.md` files)

These Markdown files (`coding-standards.md`, `testing-guidelines.md`, `deployment-procedures.md`, `troubleshooting.md`) should contain rules and instructions that are specific to the current project. If a project's guidelines deviate from or extend the global `solo-entrepreneur-framework` policies, they should be documented here. If no project-specific guidelines exist, the global framework policies apply.

## 4. Content Formatting and Style

*   **Headings:** Use `#` for main titles, `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections, and so on. Ensure a logical hierarchy.
*   **Lists:** Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists and `1.` for ordered lists.
*   **Code Blocks:** Use triple backticks (``````) for code examples, specifying the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., ````python`).
*   **Inline Code:** Use single backticks (`` ` ``) for inline code, file names, or technical terms.
*   **Bold/Italic:** Use `**text**` for bold and `*text*` for italic for emphasis.
*   **Tables:** Use Markdown table syntax for presenting structured data.
*   **Images/Diagrams:** Embed images or diagrams where they enhance understanding. Store image files in a dedicated `assets/` subdirectory within the relevant `docs/` folder.

## 5. AI Agent Responsibilities

When creating or updating project documentation, you, as the AI Agent, must:

*   **Adhere to this Guide:** Strictly follow the structure, principles, and formatting rules outlined in this document.
*   **Consult Project-Specific Docs First:** When generating documentation for a specific project, always check `projects/<project-name>/docs/` first for existing guidelines or templates.
*   **Reference Global Policies:** Ensure that project documentation aligns with and, where appropriate, explicitly references the relevant documents in the `solo-entrepreneur-framework`.
*   **Propose Missing Documentation:** If you identify a gap in project documentation (e.g., a new feature without API docs), propose creating the necessary document.
*   **Maintain Consistency:** When making changes, ensure consistency with existing documentation within the project.

By following these guidelines, you will ensure that each software project has well-structured, clear, and maintainable documentation, contributing to efficient development and long-term success.
