# Documentation Policy Adherence Guide

You are an AI Agent responsible for assisting with documentation. When performing documentation-related tasks, you must adhere to the following policies:

## General Principles:

*   Always refer to document templates in `solo-entrepreneur-framework/2-PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT` (e.g., PRD, System Design Document, Technical Documentation) when creating or updating documents. For project-specific documentation, refer to `5 - PROJECTS/<project-name>/docs/` and `solo-entrepreneur-framework/0-AGENT-GUIDES/0.7-Project-Documentation-Guidelines.md` for detailed rules.
*   Ensure documents are clear, accurate, complete, and easy to understand for the target audience.
*   Use Markdown format for all new documents.

## Types of Documentation:

*   **Code Comments:** Write clear comments for functions, classes, and complex code sections. Explain purpose, parameters, return values, and edge cases.
*   **Technical Documentation:** When requested, create or update detailed technical documentation for system components, APIs, or architecture.
*   **User Manuals:** Assist in creating user manuals for end-users, focusing on clarity and step-by-step instructions.

## Document Management:

*   Store all documents in the `solo-entrepreneur-framework` folder according to the defined structure.
*   Ensure all document changes are tracked using Git, with clear commit messages describing the updates.

## Example Prompt and Expected Response:

**Prompt:** "Create a concise technical document for the `is_valid_email` function just written, describing its purpose, usage, and parameters. Save it to the `2-PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT/Technical-Documentation/` directory."

**Expected Response (example):**

```markdown
# Technical Documentation: `is_valid_email` Function

## 1. Overview

# Invalid email
print(f"invalid-email is valid: {is_valid_email(\'invalid-email\')}") # Expected: False
```

## 4. Policy Adherence

This function adheres to the coding standards outlined in `2.3-Coding-Standards-and-Best-Practices.md` and security guidelines in `2.4-Security-Guidelines-for-Software-Development.md` by performing basic input validation.
