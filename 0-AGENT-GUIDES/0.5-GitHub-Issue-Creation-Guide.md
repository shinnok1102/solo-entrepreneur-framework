# GitHub Issue Creation Guide for AI Agent

As an AI Agent, you are responsible for assisting in the project management process by effectively utilizing GitHub Issues. This guide outlines the principles and steps for creating comprehensive and actionable GitHub Issues.

## 1. Purpose of GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues serve as the central hub for tracking all work items, including:

*   **New Features:** Ideas or requirements for new functionalities.
*   **Bugs:** Defects or errors in the existing codebase.
*   **Enhancements:** Improvements to existing features or performance.
*   **Tasks:** Smaller, actionable items that contribute to a larger feature or project.
*   **Documentation:** Tasks related to creating or updating project documentation.

## 2. Principles for Creating Issues

When creating a GitHub Issue, ensure it adheres to the following principles:

*   **Clarity:** The title and description must be clear, concise, and unambiguous.
*   **Actionability:** The issue should describe a specific, achievable task.
*   **Completeness:** Provide all necessary context, steps to reproduce (for bugs), expected behavior, and acceptance criteria.
*   **Categorization:** Use appropriate labels to categorize the issue type, priority, and relevant components.
*   **Linkage:** Link to relevant discussions, design documents, or other issues if applicable.

## 3. Steps for Creating a GitHub Issue

When prompted to create an issue, or when you identify a need for one, follow these steps:

1.  **Determine the Issue Type:** Is it a bug, a new feature, an enhancement, or a general task? This will guide your title and description.

2.  **Craft a Clear Title:** The title should summarize the issue in a single, descriptive sentence. Examples:
    *   `Bug: Login button not clickable on mobile devices`
    *   `Feature: Implement user profile editing functionality`
    *   `Enhancement: Optimize database query for user list`
    *   `Task: Update README with deployment instructions`

3.  **Write a Detailed Description:** Provide all necessary information in the issue body. Use Markdown for formatting. Include:
    *   **Problem/Goal:** Clearly state what problem the issue addresses or what goal it aims to achieve.
    *   **Context:** Any relevant background information.
    *   **Steps to Reproduce (for Bugs):** A numbered list of steps that consistently lead to the bug.
    *   **Expected Behavior (for Bugs):** What should happen if the bug were fixed.
    *   **Actual Behavior (for Bugs):** What is currently happening.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria (for Features/Enhancements/Tasks):** A clear list of conditions that must be met for the issue to be considered complete. Use checkboxes for clarity.
    *   **Relevant Links:** Link to wireframes, design mockups, external documentation, or related issues/PRs.

4.  **Apply Appropriate Labels:** Labels are crucial for organization and filtering. Always apply:
    *   **Type Label:** `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `task`, `documentation`.
    *   **Priority Label:** `p0: critical`, `p1: high`, `p2: medium`, `p3: low` (if applicable, consult `Project Plan Template` for priority definitions).
    *   **Component Label:** `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `API`, `UI/UX` (if applicable).
    *   **SDLC Phase Label:** `requirements`, `design`, `coding`, `testing`, `deployment`, `maintenance` (if applicable).

5.  **Assign to a Milestone (if applicable):** If the issue belongs to a specific release or sprint, assign it to the relevant GitHub Milestone.

6.  **Assign to Yourself (as the AI Agent):** If you are expected to work on the issue, assign it to the primary developer (the solo entrepreneur).

## 4. Example Issue Structure (for AI Agent Reference)

```markdown
### Title: Feature: Implement user profile editing functionality

### Description:

As a registered user, I want to be able to edit my profile information (e.g., name, email, password) so that I can keep my personal details up-to-date.

**Context:**
This feature is part of the user management module and is crucial for user retention and data accuracy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] User can navigate to a dedicated 


profile editing page.
- [ ] User can view their current profile information.
- [ ] User can update their name and email address.
- [ ] User can change their password (requires current password confirmation).
- [ ] Input validation is performed for all fields (e.g., valid email format, strong password).
- [ ] Error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.
- [ ] A success message is displayed upon successful profile update.
- [ ] User's session remains active after profile update.

**Relevant Links:**
- [Figma Prototype: User Profile Page](link-to-figma-prototype)
- [Related Issue: #123 - User Authentication Module](link-to-github-issue-123)

### Labels:
- `feature`
- `p1: high`
- `frontend`
- `backend`
- `requirements`

### Milestone:
- `MVP v1.0`

### Assignee:
- `@your-github-username`
```

## 5. AI Agent Responsibilities

*   **Proactive Issue Creation:** If you identify a bug during testing, or a missing feature during development, you should propose the creation of a new GitHub Issue, providing all necessary details.
*   **Issue Refinement:** If a user provides a vague request, you should ask clarifying questions and then propose a well-structured GitHub Issue based on the refined requirements.
*   **Adherence to Guidelines:** Always ensure that any issue you create or propose strictly follows the guidelines outlined in this document.

By following this guide, you will contribute to a well-organized and efficient project management workflow using GitHub.
