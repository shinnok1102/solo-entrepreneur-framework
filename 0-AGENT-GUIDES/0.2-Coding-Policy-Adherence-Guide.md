# Coding Policy Adherence Guide

You are an AI Agent responsible for assisting with code writing. When performing coding-related tasks, you must adhere to the following policies:

## General Principles:

*   Always refer to `solo-entrepreneur-framework/2-PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT/2.3-Coding-Standards-and-Best-Practices.md` for rules on variable naming, function structure, and code formatting. For project-specific coding standards, refer to `5 - PROJECTS/<project-name>/docs/coding-standards.md` if it exists, and consult `solo-entrepreneur-framework/0-AGENT-GUIDES/0.7-Project-Documentation-Guidelines.md` for general documentation rules.
*   Ensure your code is readable, maintainable, and performs well.

## Security:

*   All code you write must comply with `solo-entrepreneur-framework/2-PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT/2.4-Security-Guidelines-for-Software-Development.md`. For project-specific security guidelines, refer to `5 - PROJECTS/<project-name>/docs/security-guidelines.md` if it exists.
*   Avoid common security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
*   Never hardcode sensitive information (API keys, passwords) in the code.
*   Ensure personal data is handled according to `solo-entrepreneur-framework/3-LEGAL-AND-COMPLIANCE/3.2-Personal-Data-Processing-Procedure.md`.

## Version Control and Deployment:

*   Upon completing a feature or bug fix, ensure the code is ready for deployment according to `solo-entrepreneur-framework/2-PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT/2.5-Deployment-and-Release-Procedures.md`. For project-specific deployment procedures, refer to `5 - PROJECTS/<project-name>/docs/deployment-procedures.md` if it exists.
*   Create clear and consistent commit messages.

## Example Prompt and Expected Response:

**Prompt:** "Write a Python function to validate user email. Ensure compliance with our coding standards and basic security principles."

**Expected Response (example):**

```python
# Reference: 2.3-Coding-Standards-and-Best-Practices.md, 2.4-Security-Guidelines-for-Software-Development.md

import re

def is_valid_email(email: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validates the format of a user email.

    Complies with coding standards and basic security principles.
    """
    if not isinstance(email, str):
        # Log error or raise exception depending on company logging policy
        return False

    # Use regex to check email format
    # This regex is a basic example, may need to be more complex depending on specific requirements
    email_regex = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
"
    if re.match(email_regex, email):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Note: For higher security, consider using specialized email validation libraries
# and measures against brute-force or enumeration attacks.
```




## Git and Project Management Adherence

*   **Branching Strategy:** When starting new development, always create a new feature branch from `main`. Branch names should be descriptive and link to GitHub Issues (e.g., `feature/issue-123-user-auth`).
*   **Commit Messages:** All commit messages MUST follow Conventional Commits and include the GitHub Issue number they relate to (e.g., `feat: add user authentication module (closes #123)`).
*   **Pull Requests (PRs):** Upon completion of a feature or bug fix, create a Pull Request to `main`. The PR description MUST clearly state what the PR does and reference the GitHub Issue it resolves (e.g., `Closes #<issue-number>`).
*   **Issue Tracking:** Ensure that your development work is always tied to a GitHub Issue. If a task is not yet an issue, you should prompt for its creation or create it yourself if you have the capability.
*   **Project Board Updates:** As you progress through a task, ensure the corresponding GitHub Issue is moved through the appropriate columns on the GitHub Project board (e.g., from 'To Do' to 'In Progress', then 'In Review', and finally 'Done' upon PR merge).
