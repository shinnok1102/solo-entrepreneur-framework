# GitHub Pull Request Guide for AI Agent

As an AI Agent, you are integral to the code integration and review process. This guide outlines the principles and steps for creating effective Pull Requests (PRs) on GitHub, ensuring smooth collaboration and adherence to quality standards.

## 1. Purpose of Pull Requests

Pull Requests are fundamental for:

*   **Code Review:** Allowing for self-review and, in a collaborative setting, peer review of code changes before they are merged into the main codebase.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Integrating automated checks (CI/CD) to ensure code quality, test coverage, and adherence to coding standards.
*   **Version Control:** Managing the integration of new features or bug fixes into the main branch (`main`).
*   **Documentation:** Providing a clear record of changes and their rationale.

## 2. Principles for Creating Pull Requests

When creating a Pull Request, ensure it adheres to the following principles:

*   **Atomic Changes:** Each PR should ideally address a single feature, bug fix, or logical change. Avoid combining unrelated changes.
*   **Clear Description:** The PR description must clearly explain what changes were made, why they were made, and what problem they solve.
*   **Link to Issues:** Always link the PR to the relevant GitHub Issue(s) it addresses, ensuring automatic closure upon merge.
*   **Pass Checks:** All automated checks (CI/CD, linters, tests) must pass before a PR can be merged.
*   **Self-Review:** Even as a solo entrepreneur, perform a thorough self-review of your code before marking the PR as ready for merge.

## 3. Steps for Creating a GitHub Pull Request

When you have completed a task on a feature branch, follow these steps to create a Pull Request:

1.  **Ensure Your Branch is Up-to-Date:** Before creating a PR, ensure your feature branch is synchronized with the latest `main` branch to avoid merge conflicts.

2.  **Navigate to GitHub:** Go to your repository on GitHub. GitHub will often prompt you to create a PR if you recently pushed a new branch.

3.  **Select Base and Compare Branches:**
    *   **Base Branch:** This is typically `main` (the branch you want to merge your changes into).
    *   **Compare Branch:** This is your feature branch (the branch containing your changes).

4.  **Craft a Clear Title:** The PR title should be concise and descriptive, often mirroring the commit message of the main change or the issue title. Examples:
    *   `feat: Implement user authentication module`
    *   `fix: Resolve login button not clickable on mobile`

5.  **Write a Detailed Description:** The PR description is crucial. Include:
    *   **What:** A summary of the changes introduced in this PR.
    *   **Why:** The rationale behind these changes, linking back to the problem or feature request.
    *   **How:** A brief explanation of the technical approach taken.
    *   **Screenshots/Videos:** If applicable, include visual aids to demonstrate the changes.
    *   **Testing Notes:** Any specific instructions for testing the changes.
    *   **References:** Crucially, include the phrase `Closes #<issue-number>` (e.g., `Closes #123`) to automatically close the associated issue upon merging.

6.  **Assign Reviewers (if applicable):** While solo, this might be yourself for self-review. In the future, if collaborating, assign relevant team members.

7.  **Link to Project Board/Milestone:** Ensure the PR is linked to the correct GitHub Project card and Milestone, if not automatically done by linking the issue.

8.  **Enable Auto-Merge (Optional, for Solo):** For solo projects, you might enable auto-merge if all checks pass, to streamline the workflow.

## 4. Example Pull Request Structure (for AI Agent Reference)

```markdown
### Title: feat: Implement user profile editing functionality

### Description:

This PR introduces the functionality for users to view and update their profile information. It addresses the requirements outlined in Issue #123.

**Changes Made:**
- Added `ProfileController` to handle profile-related requests.
- Implemented `updateProfile` and `changePassword` methods.
- Created `profile_edit.html` template for the user interface.
- Added client-side validation for form fields.
- Updated `User` model to include new fields and validation rules.

**Why These Changes:**
To allow users to manage their personal information directly within the application, improving user experience and data accuracy as per the product roadmap.

**How It Was Implemented:**
Used a standard MVC pattern. Frontend form submits data to the backend API, which then updates the database. Password changes involve hashing and salting.

**Testing Notes:**
- Tested with valid and invalid email formats.
- Tested password change with correct and incorrect current passwords.
- Verified data persistence after updates.

Closes #123

### Labels:
- `feature`
- `backend`
- `frontend`
- `ready for review`

### Milestone:
- `MVP v1.0`

### Assignee:
- `@your-github-username`
```

## 5. AI Agent Responsibilities

*   **Proactive PR Creation:** Once a task on a feature branch is complete and tested, you should proactively create a Pull Request, filling in all necessary details based on the work performed and the associated GitHub Issue.
*   **Adherence to Guidelines:** Always ensure that any PR you create or propose strictly follows the guidelines outlined in this document, including proper linking to issues and clear descriptions.
*   **Automated Check Awareness:** Understand that PRs require all automated checks (CI/CD) to pass. If checks fail, you should analyze the failures and suggest corrective actions.

By following this guide, you will contribute to a robust and efficient code integration workflow using GitHub.
