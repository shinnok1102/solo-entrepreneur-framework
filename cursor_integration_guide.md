# Guide to Integrating Your Framework with Cursor IDE

## 1. Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to effectively integrate your established software development framework, including its policies, procedures, and agent guides, with the Cursor IDE. By following these steps, you will be able to leverage Cursor's AI capabilities to ensure your development process adheres to your defined standards, promoting efficiency and consistency in your solo entrepreneur journey.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Cursor IDE Installed:** Download and install the latest version of Cursor from its official website.
*   **Your Framework Repository:** The `solo-entrepreneur-framework` repository, containing all your policies, procedures, and agent guides, should be accessible on your local machine. Ideally, this repository is managed with Git, as discussed in the Document-as-Code approach.
*   **Basic Git Knowledge:** Familiarity with Git commands (clone, commit, push, pull) will be beneficial.

## 3. Setting Up Your Project in Cursor

### 3.1. Cloning Your Repository

If your framework is hosted on a Git platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), the first step is to clone it into your local development environment. Cursor, being built on VS Code, provides excellent Git integration.

1.  **Open Cursor IDE.**
2.  Go to `File > Open Folder...` or `File > Open Workspace...` if you have a `.code-workspace` file.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you want to clone your repository. If you're starting fresh, you might create a new empty folder for your projects.
4.  Open the integrated terminal in Cursor (`Terminal > New Terminal`).
5.  Use the `git clone` command to clone your repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/solo-entrepreneur-framework.git
    ```

6.  Once cloned, open the newly created folder in Cursor (`File > Open Folder...` and select the cloned repository folder).

### 3.2. Understanding the Folder Structure

Your `solo-entrepreneur-framework` repository should have a structure similar to this:

```
/solo-entrepreneur-framework
├── 0-AGENT-GUIDES/
│   ├── 0.1-General-Agent-Instructions.md
│   ├── 0.2-Coding-Policy-Adherence-Guide.md
│   ├── 0.3-Testing-Policy-Adherence-Guide.md
│   └── 0.4-Documentation-Policy-Adherence-Guide.md
├── 1-FOUNDATION/
│   ├── 1.1-Company-Vision-Mission-Core-Values.md
│   └── 1.2-Code-of-Conduct-and-Ethics.md
├── 2-PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT/
│   ├── 2.1-Product-Requirements-Document-(PRD).md
│   ├── 2.2-Software-Development-Life-Cycle.md
│   ├── 2.3-Coding-Standards-and-Best-Practices.md
│   ├── 2.4-Security-Guidelines-for-Software-Development.md
│   └── 2.5-Deployment-and-Release-Procedures.md
├── 3-LEGAL-AND-COMPLIANCE/
│   ├── 3.1-Contract-Signing-and-Management-Procedure.md
│   └── 3.2-Personal-Data-Processing-Procedure.md
└── 4-OPERATIONS/
    ├── 4.1-Customer-Complaint-Handling-Procedure.md
    └── 4.2-Project-Plan-Template.md
```

This structure is crucial for Cursor's AI to effectively reference your policies and procedures.

## 4. Guiding Cursor AI with Your Framework

Cursor's strength lies in its ability to understand context from your codebase. By placing your policy documents directly within your project's repository, you provide Cursor with immediate access to this critical information. The key is how you prompt Cursor.

### 4.1. Initial Prompt for Contextual Understanding

When you first start a new project or want to ensure Cursor is aligned with your framework, provide an initial, comprehensive prompt. This prompt acts as the 


initial "system prompt" for your AI Agent within Cursor. You can use Cursor's chat interface for this.

**Example Initial Prompt:**

```
You are an AI Agent assisting in software development for a solo entrepreneur. Your primary goal is to help me develop software quickly, efficiently, and with high quality, while strictly adhering to the company's policies and procedures. All relevant policies and procedures are located in the `/solo-entrepreneur-framework` directory within this repository. 

Before performing any task related to code, design, testing, or documentation, you MUST consult the relevant documents in the following directories:
- `/solo-entrepreneur-framework/0-AGENT-GUIDES/` (for your own operational guidelines)
- `/solo-entrepreneur-framework/1-FOUNDATION/`
- `/solo-entrepreneur-framework/2-PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT/`
- `/solo-entrepreneur-framework/3-LEGAL-AND-COMPLIANCE/`
- `/solo-entrepreneur-framework/4-OPERATIONS/`

Prioritize compliance over quick solutions. If there's a conflict or uncertainty, ask for clarification. When making suggestions or taking actions, explain your reasoning and cite the specific documents you referenced. If you identify any non-compliance, report it clearly and suggest a remedy.

I expect you to act as a 'Process Guardian' and a 'Reliable Information Source' as described in `0-AGENT-GUIDES/0.1-General-Agent-Instructions.md`.
```

This initial prompt sets the stage for Cursor, making it aware of its role and the importance of your framework documents. Cursor's context window will then include these instructions, influencing its responses and actions.

### 4.2. Referencing Documents in Specific Prompts

For specific tasks, you can explicitly direct Cursor to refer to particular documents. This is especially useful when you want to ensure a certain policy is strictly followed for a given task.

**Example Prompts:**

*   **For Coding:**
    "Write a Python function to validate user input for a web form. Ensure it strictly follows the `2.3-Coding-Standards-and-Best-Practices.md` and `2.4-Security-Guidelines-for-Software-Development.md` for input validation and secure coding practices."

*   **For Testing:**
    "Generate unit tests for the `UserAuthentication` module. Make sure the tests cover edge cases and adhere to the testing principles outlined in `0-AGENT-GUIDES/0.3-Testing-Policy-Adherence-Guide.md` and `2.2-Software-Development-Life-Cycle.md`."

*   **For Documentation:**
    "Create a technical design document for the new API endpoint. Use the `2.1-Product-Requirements-Document-(PRD).md` as a reference for requirements and structure the document according to `2-PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT/System-Design-Document-Template.md` (if you have one, otherwise refer to the PRD structure)."

*   **For Legal/Compliance:**
    "Review this new user registration flow. Does it comply with the `3.2-Personal-Data-Processing-Procedure.md`? Point out any potential non-compliance issues."

By explicitly mentioning the document paths, you reinforce to Cursor which parts of your framework are most relevant for the current task. Cursor's RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities will then prioritize these documents when generating responses.

## 5. Verifying Compliance: The 


Test Phase

After setting up Cursor and providing it with your framework, it's crucial to verify that the AI Agent understands and adheres to your policies. This can be done through a series of targeted tests and evaluations.

### 5.1. Scenario-Based Testing

Create specific scenarios that require the AI Agent to apply your policies. These scenarios should cover various aspects of your framework, including coding standards, security guidelines, testing procedures, and documentation requirements.

**Example Test Scenarios:**

1.  **Coding Standard Adherence:**
    *   **Prompt:** "Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number. Ensure variable names follow `snake_case` and function names are `lower_case_with_underscores` as per `2.3-Coding-Standards-and-Best-Practices.md`."
    *   **Evaluation:** Check if the generated code adheres to the specified naming conventions. Look for explanations from Cursor citing the relevant document.

2.  **Security Guideline Compliance:**
    *   **Prompt:** "Develop a simple user login endpoint in Node.js. Pay close attention to security, specifically preventing SQL injection and handling passwords securely, referencing `2.4-Security-Guidelines-for-Software-Development.md`."
    *   **Evaluation:** Assess if the code includes proper input sanitization, uses hashed passwords (not plain text), and avoids common vulnerabilities. Look for Cursor's explanation of security measures taken.

3.  **Testing Procedure Follow-up:**
    *   **Prompt:** "Generate unit tests for the `login` endpoint. Include tests for valid credentials, invalid credentials, and empty inputs. Ensure the test structure aligns with `0-AGENT-GUIDES/0.3-Testing-Policy-Adherence-Guide.md`."
    *   **Evaluation:** Verify that the generated tests cover the requested scenarios and follow the suggested testing principles (e.g., using a testing framework, clear test case names).

4.  **Documentation Requirement:**
    *   **Prompt:** "Create a README.md for the `login` endpoint, explaining its purpose, how to use it, and any prerequisites. Refer to general documentation practices."
    *   **Evaluation:** Check if the README is well-structured, clear, and provides all necessary information. While there isn't a specific `README.md` template, Cursor should infer best practices from other documentation guides.

### 5.2. Direct Policy Questioning

Ask Cursor direct questions about your policies to gauge its understanding.

**Example Direct Questions:**

*   "According to our `2.3-Coding-Standards-and-Best-Practices.md`, what is the preferred naming convention for Python functions?"
*   "What are the key steps for handling personal data as outlined in `3.2-Personal-Data-Processing-Procedure.md`?"
*   "If a critical bug is found during deployment, what is the first step according to `2.5-Deployment-and-Release-Procedures.md`?"

**Evaluation:** Compare Cursor's answers to the actual content of your documents. Look for accurate summaries and direct citations.

### 5.3. Iterative Refinement

If Cursor fails to adhere to a policy or provides an incorrect answer, use the opportunity to refine your prompts or even the policy documents themselves. This iterative process helps in improving both the AI Agent's understanding and the clarity of your documentation.

*   **Clarify Prompts:** If Cursor misunderstands a prompt, rephrase it to be more explicit and include direct references to the relevant documents.
*   **Update Documents:** If a policy is consistently misinterpreted, it might indicate that the policy itself needs to be clearer, more concise, or include more examples. Update the `.md` files and commit the changes to your repository.

## 6. Continuous Integration with Your Workflow

Once you are confident in Cursor's ability to follow your framework, integrate it seamlessly into your daily development workflow.

*   **Regularly use Cursor's chat:** Make it a habit to prompt Cursor for assistance, always reminding it of the relevant policies.
*   **Leverage Cursor's inline suggestions:** As you code, Cursor will provide suggestions. Review these suggestions through the lens of your policies.
*   **Automate checks (future consideration):** While Cursor helps in guiding, for critical compliance, consider integrating automated linters, static analysis tools, or custom scripts that enforce your coding standards and security guidelines as part of your CI/CD pipeline. These tools can act as a final safety net, complementing Cursor's guidance.

## 7. Conclusion

Integrating your `solo-entrepreneur-framework` with Cursor IDE is a powerful way to enforce consistency and quality in your software development process. By providing clear instructions, referencing documents explicitly, and iteratively testing Cursor's adherence, you can effectively train your AI Agent to be a diligent 'Process Guardian.' This approach not only streamlines your workflow but also ensures that your products are built according to your highest standards, even as a solo entrepreneur.
